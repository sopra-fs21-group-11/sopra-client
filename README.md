# SoPra FS21 - Group 11 - Usgrächnet Bünzen

## Introduction - project aim

Our project's aim is to implement the game *Usgrächnet Bünzen*. The original game allows users to test their
knowledge of Swiss locations in a playful manner. Each player can place location cards on a board
in relation to other locations based on their coordinates. All other players have the chance to doubt the 
card placement if they believe it is wrong. Players that continuously place cards correctly and prove other 
people's card placement to be wrong will be awarded tokens. The player with most tokens wins the game.
For a more extensive explanation of the original game please check out this **[manual](public/Usgrachnet_Help.pdf)**.


In order to introduce more complexity we added the following features:
* players can choose their **own game settings**
* players can **customize** the card decks to play with
* players can fetch international locations and create **new cards**



## Technologies

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)
  It removes the mapping between components and styles (i.e. external css files). This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it

## Launch & Deployment - for joining developers

You can clone the repo using

#### `git clone https://github.com/sopra-fs21-group-11/sopra-client.git` 

Open the project in your preferred IDE.

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

#### `npm install`

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome!).

#### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into an 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
